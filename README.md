Book Recommendation System Based on Collaborative Filtering 

Objective:  

Collaborative filtering is based on the idea of customer segmentation. It has been observed that people who have who show similar kind of behavior, e.g. past purchase pattern, feedback, amount of the purchase seem to have similar kind of product preferences. A group of customers who buy a product with high rating are more likely to buy a product of high rating. This information can be used to club users into different groups and show them the filtered results. So, the objective of this project is to develop a book recommendation system based on collaborative filtering. 

Proposed Idea:  

The main idea of the project is to hit every single part starting from the data, segregating customers into the groups and building a recommendation system.  

In the data part we can either pick the preprocessed data or the unprocessed data, but I am planning to pick the unprocessed because itâ€™s easier to format the data based on my preference than to work on some other form of data, which might be more suitable for others. E.g. changing the form of data. 

Customer segregation can be done based on various things e.g. frequency of purchase, amount of purchase, categories of the product they frequently buy. This part is highly dependent on the data available on internet. 

Last part is to build a recommendation system and integrate it to work with the last part; i.e. collaborative filtering.  

Outcome: 

The machine learning algorithms are dominantly going to be used in the customer segregation part and recommendation part. The date would need to be processed to be processed based on the machine learning algorithm used in earlier mentioned part. My goal is to apply different famous algorithms and create a comparison based on performance; i.e. time, accuracy etc.  

As there are two different parts where the ML algorithms can be applied, so it would also be possible to analyze what combination of the algorithm works best.

Note: I have proposed this idea based on my current knowledge, I would want to add things as we proceed towards the end of the course or after your review.
